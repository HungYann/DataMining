Lab 2

1. Prequisite
Perform the following steps before trying the lab test 2:

Import pandas as "pd" and load the house price dataset into "df".
Print dataset information to refresh your memory.
Run preprocess_data function on the dataframe to perform preprocessing steps 
discussed last week (lab 1 dataset).


2. Data Partitioning
Perform following operations and answer the following questions:

a) Describe training, validation and test dataset. 
b) What is the purpose for each of these split?
c) What is k-fold cross validation? 
d) What is the advantage and disadvantage of k-fold CV compared to normal 
training/test/validation method?

3. Decision Tree
Perform the following operations and answer the question.

a) Import and build a decision tree classifier. 
b) Set the random state to 0 to ensure your result is similar with the answers. 
c) Fit it against the training data.
d) What is the performance of the model against training data? 
e) How about against the test data? Do you see any indication of overfitting here?
f) What are the top 5 most important features in this model?
g) Visualise the structure of your decision tree. Can you identify characteristics of important features?
